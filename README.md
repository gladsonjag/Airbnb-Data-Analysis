# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
A small project to show skills in Data Analysis and also skills using SQL databases.

#This project was my first real expirence with SQL which turns out is very simple and easy once you get a foundational understanding.
#Note this project is just to show I can use SQL, which I used Microsoft SQL for, and it doesnt make sense in terms of effectiveness, as I got a csv.gz file of airbnb data off of the internet to analyze but I created my Own SQL database and a airbnb table within that database to store the csv file data. after importing the file I queried the desired column information from the SQL database table and exported into a CSV. this was then brought back into a pandas dataframe(what im most efficent in manupilatiing) to be analyzed.

#I explained most processies in the .py file where im executing some small code to create a matploylib scatter plot of some interesting airbnb data, and an effective way for a consumer to find the most effective money spending for an airbnb in austin TX.

#Please note this project wasnt for the data analysis this was just a template to teach myself how to use SQL and create/manipulate databases and they tables they store inside them.
